## üì¶ System Overview

The system integrates the following perception capabilities:

- **Line Detection** using a 16-channel **Velodyne LiDAR** with assisted line segmentation.
- **Traffic Light Detection** using an **Intel RGB camera**.
- **Traffic Sign Recognition** via the Intel camera.
- **Radar Fusion** using data from **3 radar sensors** to assist in dynamic object detection and tracking.

## üß† Perception Modules

### 1. Line Detection
- Uses 3D point cloud data from Velodyne LiDAR.
- Performs assisted segmentation for robust lane line detection in urban and highway environments.

### 2. Traffic Light Detection
- Real-time detection using RGB image input.
- Color and state recognition (Red / Yellow / Green).
- Machine learning enhancements optional for improved robustness.

### 3. Traffic Sign Recognition
- Classifies and localizes common traffic signs (e.g., Stop, Yield, Speed Limit).
- Pre-trained model integration or custom training supported.

### 4. Radar Integration
- Supports 3 radar sensors placed at different angles.
- Fuses object data with LiDAR and camera detections.
- Useful for detecting vehicles and obstacles in poor visibility.
